## Hmm.. what is Discord Cache folder contains?
- In my opinion, it contains **most of image type media in your Discord** _(users pfp, emotes, server channel medias, images, memes, etc...)_

# How to use
- **Make sure** your _Discord Cache folder_ located in **C** Drive (specifically in `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME_DOES_NOT_MATTER\AppData\Roaming\Discord\Cache`). Otherwise, the executable file won't work :))
- Run the executable file **launcher.exe**. It will convert all files in the Cache folder into image files and **move** it to a new created folder **Discord_Cache_Images**
