## Hmm.. what is Discord Cache folder contains?
- In my opinion, it contains **most of image type media in your Discord** _(users pfp, emotes, server channel medias, images, memes, etc...)_

# How to use
<a name="before_run"/></a>
## Before you run `launcher.exe`:
- **Make sure** your _Discord Cache folder_ located in **C** Drive (specifically in `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME_DOES_NOT_MATTER\AppData\Roaming\Discord\Cache`). Otherwise, the executable file won't work :))
- Make sure to enable Extension file, to enable it, simply do:
	- **Win \+ E** to open Windows Explorer, goto options:
		- ![tutorial_s_1](./trash/step_1.png)
	- Goto **View** Tab and **untick** the option `Hide extensions for known file types`
		- ![tutorial_s_2](./trash/step_2.png)

<a name="while_run"/></a>
## To run `launcher.exe`:
- Make sure to run it in any of the **C** Drive to avoid **permisson denied** problem and **run it as administrator**
- It will convert all files in the Cache folder into image files and **move** it to a new created folder **Discord_Cache_Images**
